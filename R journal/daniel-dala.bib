	abstract="The smoothing spline based neural network is used for prediction of a trend from complex and noisy time series. First, the time series is smoothed by a cubic spline and then multilayered feedforward neural networks are applied to predict the parameters of the spline and by this the next values of the smoothed time series. The level of smoothing can be chosen by the smoothing parameter. We show that in the case of a complex time series like the bike tire sale, prediction of a trend with the smoothing spline based neural network gives us more reliable information than a classical prediction with the multilayered feedforward neural network.",

The series is expressed as the sum of deterministic trend, random walk, and stationary error, and the test is the LM test of the hypothesis that the random walk has zero variance. The asymptotic distribution of the statistic is derived under the null and under the alternative that the series is difference-stationary. Finite sample size and power are considered in a Monte Carlo experiment. The test is applied to the Nelson-Plosser data, and for many of these series the hypothesis of trend stationarity cannot be rejected.}

The proposed test procedure employs the skewness-kurtosis test statistic, but studentized by standard error estimators that are consistent under serial dependence of the observations. The standard error estimators are sample versions of the asymptotic quantities that do not incorporate any downweighting, and, hence, no smoothing parameter is needed. Therefore, the main feature of our proposed test is its simplicity, because it does not require the selection of any user-chosen parameter such as a smoothing number or the order of an approximating model.},
